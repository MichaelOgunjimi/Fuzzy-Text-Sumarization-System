Microsoft OneDrive is a cloud storage service that allows users to access and share their documents, photos, and other files from any device. It is accessible through OneDrive.com, mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone, and on PC or Mac. The OneDrive folder on your computer keeps your files up-to-date, and anything added or edited in there syncs via the cloud to other devices or people you've shared with. To get started, drag and drop files into OneDrive, add files from your mobile device, and turn on camera upload to save photos and videos. Sharing files with OneDrive is easy, and photos and albums can be easily shared with friends and family. Office 365 offers more storage and premium features, including 1 TB of storage, exclusive tools, and the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook for PC, Mac, and mobile devices.
